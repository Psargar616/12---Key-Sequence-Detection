# Day 12 of JS30 challenge

Learned about Key Sequence Detection (KONAMI CODE):


On the web page, when the" up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a" button/key sequence is entered correctly, you will display Cheat code activated and get unicorns and rainbows displayed on webpage because of   cornify_add()! inside an alert dialog (window.alert). If an incorrect key is pressed at any point, the code resets and you have to start over from the beginning. The keys need to be pressed relatively quickly in succession. If the time between subsequent keypresses goes over 1 second, the code resets and you have to start over - similar to what you would do if you pressed an incorrect key.
